My personal website is designed to be a space where I can communicate with no distractions. Since the focus is on communication of my work and writings, I placed special emphasis on the text while designing the site.

This emphasis grew into an obsession so, for the first time, I've created a site with no fancy animations, no buttons calling for your attention and no JavaScript.

The site is written in [Astro](https://astro.build) and I tried to apply some of the principles of [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi) to simplify the styling logic. I found this method enjoyable to use, though I gleaned little benefit since the site is deliberately simple and the component-oriented nature of Astro allows scoped styling anyway.
