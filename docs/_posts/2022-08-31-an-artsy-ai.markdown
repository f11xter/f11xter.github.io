excerpt: "What is an artist without their brush? What is a brush without its artist?"

Allow me to set the scene. It's late on a Wednesday evening and you've opened your social media of choice, only to find it flooded with outrage about Jason Allen winning an art competition. Or is everyone mad about an AI winning an art competition?

Allen spent "many weeks fine tuning and curating" short text snippets that he fed as prompts to the Midjourney AI art generator. He created hundreds of images this way before picking his favourites, upscaling them with Gigapixel AI and entering the competition.

Despite entering the digital art category, many internet users appear to feel he somehow cheated by not entering "his own art". I can only conclude that they've never attempted to make such an ambitious piece themselves; in my short time experimenting with the DALL-E 2 beta I've found that the most minor change can have a fundamental effect on the program's output, making the creation of pre-conceived art very difficult.

At its core, the main objection people raised was that Allen won too easily: there was no motor skill involved, he just had to write a few words on a keyboard. As has been pointed out many times however, this sounds remarkably similar to the original concerns about photography: "you just point and click". 

> One day, Jack's boiler stopped working, so he called a mechanic. The mechanic arrived, inspected the boiler for a while then went back to his car. Soon after, he returned with a hammer and proceeded to give the boiler a good whack.
>
> The mechanic asked Jack for £100.
>
> "£100?" said Jack, "All you did was hit the thing!"
>
> "Alright then," said the mechanic, "£10 for hitting the boiler, £90 for knowing where to hit it."

That's one of my dad's favourite anecdotes. The point it makes is that neither the tool nor the action is important, rather the knowledge of which action and which tool are best suited for the particular job at hand.

Allen had an artistic vision that he used his experience with the Midjourney AI to realise. The fact that he used one tool over another is irrelevant. To say otherwise would be like claiming an artist's work was somehow less worthy than another's because they made a sculpture instead of a watercolour. Maybe those pieces shouldn't be competing with each other. Maybe you don't like the watercolour. Maybe you saw the sculpture and exclaimed, "I could've done that!" despite knowing that, as always, what matters is that you didn't.

Just let the artists make their art.
