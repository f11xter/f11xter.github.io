> I'm godot-ing to start again

Every developer's best friend, [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship), shared a new video today titled [Godot in 100 Seconds](https://youtu.be/QKgTZWbwD1U) and I think I'm in love.

Progress has stalled on Animal Astronauts for some time now, in part due to having to do boring things like "study for a degree" and "cook 3 meals a day", but mostly because I spend all my time in Fedora, making switching to Windows just for one project feel like an insurmountable burden.

Imagine my joy to find that an excellent alternative exists and has a cute mascot to go with it!

To be clear, I'm not about to suddenly make lots of progress, but I can promise to spend more time daydreaming about animals in space during my lectures.
