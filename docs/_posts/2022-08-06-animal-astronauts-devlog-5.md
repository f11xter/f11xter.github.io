> Disaster!

Today I was searching for how to make a modal dialog when I discovered that I've been using the old UI system, rather than the one built upon the web technologies I'm familiar with. So much jank for nothing!

I spent a long time reading the documentation for the UI Toolkit, since it isn't quite the CSS and HTML I'm used to. I'm confident this will make development faster though.

Now to rewrite everything I've done.
