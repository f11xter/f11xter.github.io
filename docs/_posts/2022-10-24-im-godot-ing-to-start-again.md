> I'm godot-ing to start again

Every developer's best friend, [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship), shared a new video today titled [Godot in 100 Seconds](https://youtu.be/QKgTZWbwD1U) and I think I'm in love.

Progress has stalled on Animal Astronauts for some time now, in part due to having to do boring things like "study for a degree" and "cook 3 meals a day", but mostly because of Unity's OS compatibility (incompatibility). I spend all my time in Fedora, so switching to Windows just for one project feels like an insurmountable burden.

You can only imagine my joy when I found that not only does an excellent alternative to Unity exists, but it has a cute mascot to go with it!

To be clear, I'm not about to suddenly make lots of progress, but I can promise to spend more time daydreaming about animals drifting through space during my lectures.
