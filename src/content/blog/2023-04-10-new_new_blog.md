Whoooo!!! It's here!!!

After a great deal of work my new website is finally finished! Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and love, I've completely nuked the old site in favour of taking the web back to its roots, where a website was just a collection of links and text.

At launch, I've kept it pretty bare-bones: I've included only a couple of projects (one of which isn't *quite* released yet), a single blog post (yes I mean this one) and not only are there zero interactive elements, there are no pictures either!

Over time I'll add some playful elements and even some colour (daring, I know), or maybe I won't. Who knows?

For now I'm focusing on reanimating some projects from my graveyard of ideas, so check back for new releases soon&trade;.
