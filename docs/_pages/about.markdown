**Hey there!**

I’m a 19-year-old programmer in my second year studying Computer Science at The University of Manchester.

I’m also a 19-year-old cellist studying with [Simon Turner](https://simonturnercello.wordpress.com/).

Check out some of my [projects](https://f11xter.github.io/projects).

## Tools I use:
JavaScript, Vue, React, HTML, CSS, Python, Unity, C#, Flutter, Dart, Java 

## About my logo:
My logo fuses together my two main hobbies: music and coding. The concept was to combine the `C:\>` prompt found in cmd.exe with the bass clef that I read music in as a cellist.
