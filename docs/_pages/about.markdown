Hey there!

I'm a 19-year-old programmer in my first year studying Computer Science at [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/).

I'm also a 19-year-old cellist studying with [Simon Turner](https://simonturnercello.wordpress.com/). 
More info can be found over on my [music website](https://felixwallerdev.wixsite.com/strings) for now.

I'm mainly interested in software development but am always eager to get stuck into other areas.
