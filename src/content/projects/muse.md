*muse* is a webapp for stream-of-consciousness journalling. It limits you to 99 short lines of text, with no ability to edit any but the current line, encouraging you to write exactly as you feel in the moment. Then, you can save your musings, before watching your words fade into the past.

I have found the site most useful when I'm feeling confused or disoriented. Writing down my thoughts and feelings allows me to better understand them and *muse* gives me the freedom to do so without worrying about the words themselves.

The site works without signing up, allowing you to write and download musings, but an account is required to save your musings online to read later.

The site is written in vanilla HTML, CSS & JS and use Firebase as an authentication backend and document NoSQL database. I opted not to use a framework for this project to aid in simplicity (despite more repeated code) and to improve my understanding of the essential tools I use.
