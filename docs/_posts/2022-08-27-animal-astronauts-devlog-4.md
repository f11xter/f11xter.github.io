> You spin me right round, baby...

The pointless planet has pointless friends! By arranging four planets around the camera, I can animate between them with a nice easing rotation. I've spent more time travelling between the planets than programming today.

I've also started to sketch out the logic of the outposts and have discovered the wonders of automatic layouts. No more absolute positioning for this guy.
