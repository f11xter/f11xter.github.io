*Celebrate!* is a small webapp, promoting positive thinking. I built it during a time when overwhelming responsibilities meant I was getting nothing done. The idea is simple: once a day, write down everything you achieved (no matter how small) to earn a glowing compliment.

By listing all the small things you've done in a day, you can reduce stress about productivity: seeing a long list of small things such as "drank water" or "rested" is often more heartening than a short list of uncompleted projects or no list at all.

Once you've completed your list, the site will think for a moment before giving you a compliment in a warm orange colour.

*Celebrate!* is written in vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. It uses a 1-column design to emphasise its simplicity and encourage users to focus on the content. The loading bar is animated with random delays to make the site feel more dynamic and genuine, since the compliment is selected at random from a pre-determined list (even knowing this, users still enjoy the site and have benefited from its use).

One of the simplest projects I've ever made, it is also my favourite. It has made a great positive impact on my and many others' lives and is a great place to seek judgement-free affirmation.
