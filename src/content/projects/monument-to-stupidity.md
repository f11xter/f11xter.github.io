The *Monument to Stupidity* is a place to share your mistakes with the world. Sometimes we mess up and that's OK. Share your stories completely anonymously and join us in celebrating our ongoing stupidity.

While [*Celebrate!*](#celebrate) is a place to take pride in the good things, the *Monument* is a place to laugh at the bad. When I make a mistake, I want to learn from it and share it with the world, so I created a place to do that free of judgement.

This website uses [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) for its backend and is essentially a paginated list of people's most recent mistakes and a form where you can submit your own. Its design is very simple, taking inspiration from the [Neurodiversity Design System](https://neurodiversity.design) to make the site as easy and pleasant to use as possible.
