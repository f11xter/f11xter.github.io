One day I was innocently playing an incremental game when I thought to myself, "What if this was multiplayer?". Thus was born **Animal Astronauts**.

The concept is simple: there are animals, and they're astronauts. Oh and you work with your friends to progress through star systems, making the numbers on your screen grow with time.

This series of very short devlogs will detail the development process, as well as my discovery of Unity. They can be found under the [animal-astronauts](/tags/#animal-astronauts) tag.
