When I'm learning to play a new piece, I tend to go through the same 4 basic steps.

1. **Learn the notes** &mdash; read the music, listen to a recording and get the basic movements under the fingers.
2. **Lock in the tuning and rhythm** &mdash; playing "in tune" and "at the right time" is harder than you think, I swear!
3. **Add the written expression** &mdash; this includes articulations (short, smooth), dynamics (loud, soft), tempo markings (fast, mournful).
4. **Play a story** - bring my own meaning to the piece.

In practice these often blend into each other, since it's hard to know what rhythm to play if I don't know what I'm trying to say for example. There's still one problem though: at the end of this process, I still don't know if I actually sound _good_.

Traditionally, this is where a teacher comes in. They listen to you play and tell you what needs improving and how to do so. That said, it's horribly inefficient to practice a piece one way, only to go to your lesson and be told to do the polar opposite.

So, I have decided to become the teacher.

When I reach step 4, I record multiple takes of a short passage. Then, I listen, analyse and adjust my playing before trying again. This way I can hear what I sound like to an audience, without having to wait for the next time my teacher's in town.

I'm currently collecting these recordings in preparation for creating a tour through the process of learning a piece. My hope is it'll create quite a satisfying journey from fumbling and unsure to a heart-wrenching marvel of the modern world. More likely, you'll just hear me get more and more annoyed that I can't _quite_ hit that shift...

Here's a little taster of progress on [Kodaly's "Sonata for Solo Cello" Op 8](https://cupoftea.social/@f11xter/110414113794421182).
