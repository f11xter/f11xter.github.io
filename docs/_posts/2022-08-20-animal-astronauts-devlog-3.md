excerpt: "I can't live like this."

> I can't live like this.

So I've given up on making something quick and ugly. From now on, I'll be prototyping design and layouts on top of functionality. I just couldn't bring myself to continue to put out work that made me gag every time I loaded it up.

I've added an Outposts scene, where secondary resources will be gathered, though I spent most of the time making a planet look good. It won't even be in the final game. Why have I spent three hours on this? It spins by the way. Wheeeeee.
