> You've got to start somewhere, I guess.

After a few hours down the rabbit hole of which game engine to choose, I've settled with Unity for its familiarity and use of C# - a language I'm familiar with.
My first goal is to reach a minimally working game as soon as possible, so I'll be taking a route unknown to me: ignoring aesthetics.

I've started experimenting with the UI of the home page, where players will tap on 4 different objects to gain the 4 basic resources: oxygen, energy, water and food.
I'm absolutely positioning everything for now (and working with an iPhone 13 aspect ratio) - future me can worry about responsive design.
