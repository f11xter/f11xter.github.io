Welcome to my shiny new blog!

I plan to use this space to discuss projects I'm working on, as well as any thoughts I have about ... anything.

Expect posts about coding projects past, present and potential, analysis of music I've been listening to, and devlogs of my own music production.

This site is built with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and is themed by [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). Its source code can be found [here](https://github.com/f11xter/f11xter.github.io).
