_Eurotally_ is a Eurovision companion app allowing friends to rate each performance in different categories, ranging from the vocals to the outfits. It uses a following / follower based system to show you your friends' votes and calculate the average for each category. It allows friends to see what they think, even if they're halfway across the globe.

I won't be able to watch Eurovision with my family this year, so I wanted to create a way that I would still be able to enjoy it with them. _Eurotally_ gives me the opportunity to see what they're feeling in real time, and share my own thoughts as well.

The website is built with [Vue](https://vuejs.org) as a SPA and uses [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) for authentication and database backend services. Pocketbase was great fun to build with, due largely to its ease of use, though it did have shortcomings in its flexibility that will be featured in a blog post soon.

This site pushed me out of my comfort zone, as I had to create something that was fun to use and echoed the noisy and vibrant atmostphere of Eurovision. A plain black and white wall of text would not work here!

As it stands, there's a great deal more that could be done to improve the site, but that will have to wait till next year!
